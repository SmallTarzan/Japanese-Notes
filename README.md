# Japanese-Notes

None of this is functional yet. Please avoid cloning or downloading this repository.

One day there will be all knowledge of the Japanese language I've gathered in my life, and all that I'm yet to find.

Things you won't find here:
1. Hiragana
2. Katakana
3. Mercy
4. Japanese without Kanji

I'll make a "How to use" guide here as well.
