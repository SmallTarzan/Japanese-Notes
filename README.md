# Japanese-Notes

None of this is functional yet. Please avoid cloning or downloading this repository.

One day there will be all knowledge of the Japanese language I've gathered in my life, and all that I'm yet to find.

Things you won't find here:
1. Hiragana
2. Katakana
3. Mercy
4. Japanese without Kanji
5. Useless knowledge from books (While this guide follows books like Genki (元気) and Minna no Nihongo (みんなの日本語), it may and will have a lot of sections skipped - the ones I don't consider useful at the moment.)

I'll make a "How to use" guide here as well.
