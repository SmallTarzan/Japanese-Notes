# Japanese-Notes

None of this is functional yet. Please avoid cloning, downloading or forking this repository.

This uses Obsidian as a note-keeping and note-organizing tool.

One day there will be all knowledge of the Japanese language I've gathered in my life, and all that I'm yet to find.

Things you won't find here and things you should know:
1. Hiragana
2. Katakana
3. Mercy
4. Japanese without Kanji
5. Useless knowledge from books (While this guide follows books like Genki (元気) and Minna no Nihongo (みんなの日本語), it may and will have a lot of sections skipped - the ones I don't consider useful at the moment.)

I'll make a "How to use" guide here as well when this repo becomes functional.

This guide is basically a compilation of things you should spend your time on.
