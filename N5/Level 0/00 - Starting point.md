# wHaT dO I dO?
First of all, stop asking the same question all over again;
## bUt hOw dO I LeArN JaPaNeSe ? ? ?
I'll tell you how. But first, you have to stop YELLING AT ME! *And stop putting spaces in between and in front of question marks. For real.*

Ok? Ok, good.

I'll try to take your hand and guide you through the beautiful (and sometimes psychically and physically draining) world of learning Japanese.

Ready?

No? Okay, bye!
